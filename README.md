### UW-Password-Generator

- Introduction to Javascript was quite brutal! it seemed logical and retainable at first, but now I've been putting in countless hours and making little progress. I've been re-watching class videos (as much as my crazy schedule allows) and going over the in-class activities, but I still find my self stumped, mainly I don't know where to start! I need to take advantage of the great support system this progam has. I will get a bit of sleep and continue in a few!

- Before doing so, just want to explain a bit about homework 3. It asked us to build a password generator. I didn't realize the html was already given in the homework, but I suppose it was good for me to start from scratch (thank you Google!!). So far I've been creating variables, functions and starting to implement event handlers. It is challenging but I'm sure do-able, just need to practice more, a bunch more! Stay tuned..

- Read homework README more thoroughly, need to alter code based on user-selected criteria, implement prompts for user to select character type etc. I am also having trouble with password length, I would get too much randomization with less than the 8 character password requirement. Will ask for help during class!

- In class today I spoke with my classmate and TA and figured out how to prompt, specify and retrieve desired password length. With a few edits here and there, I'm almost at the finish line - yayy!

- I finally finished Javascript after adding function password range to make sure users were promped again if they picked password length less than 8 or greater than 128. In a nutshell, as the page renders, the user is prompted to pick a number between 8 and 128, and either ok or cancel for uppercase, lowercase, special or number character. In this particular generator, at least one criteria must be chosen or else an alert will pop up and repeats the function. Similarly, when the user is asked to pick a number between 8 and 128 and chooses a number less than 8 or more than 128, an alert pops up and repeats the function. After choosing at least one criteria, a password length between 8 and 128, the user clicks on the generate button to generate random passwords which render to the page under previous password header. The user then has an option to save a copy on clipboard by clicking on the Copy to clipboard button. Ta-da, we are done!

- All in all, I found this homework/project to be extremely challenging, spending hours on end figuring out how to start building, writing, and reviewing. However, it was a very educational lesson in being introduced to Javascript and using it to provide functionality to the page.
