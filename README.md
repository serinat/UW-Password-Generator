### UW-Password-Generator

- Introduction to Javascript was quite brutal! it seemed logical and retainable at first, but now I've been putting in countless hours and making little progress. I've been re-watching class videos (as much as my crazy schedule allows) and going over the in-class activities, but I'm still stumped! I need to take advantage of the great support system this progam has. I will get a bit of sleep and continue in a few!

- Before doing so, just want to explain a bit about homework 3. It asked us to build a password generator. I didn't realize the html was already given in the homework, but I suppose it was good for me to start from scratch (thank you Google!!). So far I've been creating variables, functions and starting to implement event handlers. It is challenging but I'm sure do-able, just need to practice a bunch more. Stay tuned..

- Read homework README more thoroughly, need to alter code based on user-selected criteria. Implement prompts for user to select password length, character type, etc.
